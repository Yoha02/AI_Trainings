        "### What is a Vector Database?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **vector database** is a specialized database designed to store and search **embeddings** (numerical representations of data). Unlike traditional databases that search for exact matches, vector databases find items that are **semantically similar**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "- Traditional search: \"diet soda\" only finds items with those exact words\n",
        "- Vector search: \"diet soda\" also finds \"zero calorie beverage\", \"sugar-free drink\", etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What are Embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Embeddings** are numerical representations (arrays of numbers) that capture the **meaning** of text. Similar texts have similar embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "\"I love cats\" → [0.12, -0.34, 0.56, ...]  (384 numbers)\n",
        "\"I adore kittens\" → [0.11, -0.33, 0.55, ...]  (similar numbers!)\n",
        "\"I hate Mondays\" → [-0.45, 0.22, -0.18, ...]  (different numbers)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Similarity Search?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Similarity search** finds items in the database whose embeddings are closest to a query embedding. This is measured using distance metrics like **cosine similarity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Qdrant?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Qdrant** is an open-source vector database that:\n",
        "-  Is fast and scalable\n",
        "-  Supports metadata filtering\n",
        "-  Has a generous free cloud tier (On the cloud hosted platform)\n",

As the awe-inspiring trendsetter of the iconic flavor, Sprite never fails to deliver exactly what it promises, every single time. After all, it’s been doing that for 50 years already.\\n  \\nFor the people who love a little more zing, there’s a variety of different Sprite flavors, like Cherry and Tropical Mix, as well as zero calorie and zero sugar options. And while the original Sprite is its own brand of perfection, its different flavor options offer a brand-new soda experience. \\n   \\nSprite delivers intense, crisp citrus taste in every single sip. So when it comes to the ultimate lemon-lime flavored drink, there’s only one place to turn—the flavor that started it all.'}"
